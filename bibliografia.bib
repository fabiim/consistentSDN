 Distributed Systems provides students of computer science and engineering with the skills they will need to design and maintain software for distributed applications. It will also be invaluable to software engineers and systems designers wishing to understand new and future developments in the field.
 
 From mobile phones to the Internet, our lives depend increasingly on distributed systems linking computers and other devices together in a seamless and transparent way. The fifth edition of this best-selling text continues to provide a comprehensive source of material on the principles and practice of distributed computer systems and the exciting new developments based on them, using a wealth of modern case studies to illustrate their design and development. The depth of coverage will enable readers to evaluate existing distributed systems and design new ones.},

This implementation has several appealing properties: it guarantees that progress will be made whenever a majority of replicas can communicate with each other; it allows minority partitions to continue providing service for idempotent requests; it offers the application the choice between optimistic or safe message delivery. Performance measurements have shown that our implementation incurs low latency and achieves high throughput while providing globally consistent replicated state machine semantics View full abstract},

    abstract = {{Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation. Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types supporting both \add and \remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial CRDTs.}},

abstract = {In this paper we present OpenTM, a traffic matrix estimation system for OpenFlow networks. OpenTM uses built-in features provided in OpenFlow switches to directly and accurately measure the traffic matrix with a low overhead. Additionally, OpenTM uses the routing information learned from the OpenFlow controller to intelligently choose the switches from which to obtain flow statistics, thus reducing the load on switching elements. We explore several algorithms for choosing which switches to query, and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between accuracy of measurements, and the worst case maximum load on individual switches, i.e., the perfect load balancing scheme sometimes results in the worst estimate, and the best estimation can lead to worst case load distribution among switches. We show that a non-uniform distribution querying strategy that tends to query switches closer to the destination with a higher probability has a better performance compared to the uniform schemes. Our test-bed experiments show that for a stationary traffic matrix OpenTM normally converges within ten queries which is considerably faster than existing traffic matrix estimation techniques for traditional IP networks.},
